# Permission Model

## Overview

The permission system is a **unified rule-list model**: a flat ordered list of rules evaluated top-to-bottom, first full match wins. There is no "deny beats allow" override — order is the only priority mechanism.

Rules are assembled from config layers and evaluated by `PermissionEngine` in `/src/shared/permission.ts`. The engine is constructed once per invocation and reused across caller-level and resource-level checks.

Endpoint classification is metadata. Approval is triggered by explicit permission effects, not by derived severity.

---

## Rule structure

Each rule has optional conditions and a mandatory effect:

| Field | Match method | Omitted means |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| `endpoint` | glob (micromatch) on endpoint id | any endpoint |
| `tool` | glob (micromatch) on tool id | any tool (or no tool) |
| `action` | exact: `read` \| `write` \| `invoke` | any action |
| `notebook` | exact match on notebook id | any notebook |
| `path` | glob (micromatch) on SiYuan id-based path | any path |
| `root_id` | convenience alias, normalized to `path: "**/<id>.sy"` | any root |
| `effect` | — | **required**: `allow` \| `deny` \| `approval` |
| `note` | — | ignored; human annotation |

A rule with no conditions matches every context — useful as a final catch-all.

**`root_id` is a convenience alias.** When set, it is normalized to `path: "**/<root_id>.sy"` during config loading. If both `root_id` and `path` are set, a `ROOT_ID_OVERRIDES_PATH` warning is emitted and `root_id` takes precedence. `root_id` values missing the `.sy` suffix trigger a `LIKELY_PATH_MISSING_SY_SUFFIX` warning.

**`notebook` and `path` only accept ID-based values**, not hpaths. Reason: hpaths are mutable (renaming a document changes its hpath), while IDs are stable. The engine does not resolve hpaths. A smoke-test warning (`LIKELY_HPATH_NOT_ID`, `LIKELY_HPATH_NOT_ID_IN_PATH`) is emitted on config load when a value looks like an hpath.

**Unknown rule fields are hard errors.** Global config, workspace config, and project config validate rule keys before normalization. This prevents a typo or unsupported condition such as `risk: high` from being silently ignored and turning the rule into a broad match.

## Rule cascade

Without a project override, the final rule list and default effect are assembled from the global config:

```text
final rules   = workspace.rules ++ defaults.rules
final default = workspace.default ?? defaults.default ?? "allow"
```

Implemented in `cascadePermission()` in `/src/shared/permission.ts`.

When project permission exists, project rules are prepended before workspace/default rules:

```text
final rules   = project.rules ++ workspace.rules ++ defaults.rules
final default = project.default ?? workspace.default ?? defaults.default ?? "allow"
```

Because evaluation is first-match-wins, project rules shadow workspace/defaults rules for any context they cover. Workspace/defaults rules remain in the list and still apply to contexts the project rules did not match.

The project `permission` block is **independent of how the workspace name was determined**. If `--workspace prod` overrides the workspace but a `.siyuan-cli.yaml` is found in cwd, the project's permission still applies. Rationale: `--workspace` expresses "use a different target", while the project file expresses "in this directory, these rules apply" — they are orthogonal.

## Action semantics

Permission action uses endpoint classification action:

```text
classification.action: read   -> permission action: read
classification.action: write  -> permission action: write
classification.action: invoke -> permission action: invoke
```

`invoke` is not folded into `write` for permission rule matching. A rule with `action: write` matches write endpoints only. A rule without `action` matches all actions.

Resource access (`guard.payloadTargets[*].access`) remains `read | write` and describes the resource operation direction, but does not determine the permission action passed to the engine. Endpoint `action` (`read | write | invoke`) is used for both caller-level (Phase 1) and resource-level (Phase 2) rule matching.

Code refs: `/src/api/guard.ts#executeEndpoint`, `/src/api/guard.ts#applyPayloadGuard`, `/src/shared/permission.ts#matchesCaller`.

---

## Two-phase evaluation

Permission checks are split into two phases because the available context differs at each point in the execution pipeline.

### Phase 1 — caller gate (`checkEndpoint` / `checkTool`)

Called before the kernel request. Only caller info is available: `endpoint`, `tool`, `action`.

Three outcomes:

1. **A pure-caller deny rule matches** (rule has no `notebook`/`path` conditions) → throw `EndpointDeniedError` immediately.
2. **Only resource-qualified rules match this caller** → defer; Phase 2 will decide once resource info is available. Default is NOT applied here.
3. **No rules match** → apply default. If default is `deny`, throw immediately.

"Pure-caller" means the rule has no `notebook` or `path` conditions. Such rules produce immediate verdicts in Phase 1.

### Phase 2 — resource gate (`checkContentRef` / `filterItems`)

Called from `applyPayloadGuard` in `/src/api/guard.ts`, once per `payloadTarget` declared in the endpoint schema. Full context is available: `endpoint`, `tool`, `action`, `notebook`, `path`.

- Runs `evaluateVerbose()` against the full rule list (same list as Phase 1 — no separation).
- If effect is `deny` → throw `ContentDeniedError`.
- If effect is `allow` or `approval` → pass through. Approval is handled separately in the approval gate.

**Phase 2 only runs if the endpoint declares `payloadTargets`.** If an endpoint has no `payloadTargets`, resource-qualified rules targeting that endpoint's resources are never evaluated. The endpoint schema author is responsible for declaring `payloadTargets` for endpoints where resource-level rules should apply.

---

## Approval gate

After both phases pass, `executeEndpoint()` evaluates the approval gate.

Approval sources:

1. **Pure-caller `approval` rule**: `engine.evaluate({ endpoint, tool?, action })` returns `approval`.
2. **Resource-level `approval` rule**: Phase 2 (`applyPayloadGuard`) returns `{{ needsApproval: true }` when any `checkContentRef` call encounters an `approval` effect.

```ts
const ruleEffect = engine.evaluate({ endpoint, tool?, action });
const { needsApproval: phase2NeedsApproval } = await applyPayloadGuard(...);
const wouldRequestApproval =
    ruleEffect === 'approval' ||
    phase2NeedsApproval;
```

There is no classification-derived approval fallback. Derived `severity` is display metadata and warning input, not policy.

### `approval` effect asymmetry: payload vs response

`approval` is a **pre-execution gate**. It applies to payload checks (Phase 1 and Phase 2) and triggers before the kernel call.

For **response filtering** (`guard.response` / `filterItems` on the response), only `deny` is meaningful. Items matched by an `approval` rule in the response are kept (treated as `allow`). By the time the response arrives, the kernel has already executed the operation — there is nothing left to confirm.

---

## Rule ordering patterns

Order is the only priority mechanism. Two canonical patterns:

```yaml
# Pattern A: broad allow + specific deny
# Specific deny MUST come before the broad allow.
rules:
  - notebook: "A"
    path: "/secret/**"
    effect: deny      # ① specific — checked first
  - notebook: "A"
    effect: allow     # ② broad — only reached when ① doesn't match

# Pattern B: broad deny + specific allow
# Specific allow MUST come before the catch-all deny.
rules:
  - tool: "append-content"
    notebook: "A"
    effect: allow     # ① specific allow — checked first
  - action: write
    effect: deny      # ② broad write deny — reached for everything else
```

A pure-caller rule placed before a resource-qualified rule will shadow it for any caller that matches, because `matchesResource` returns true for rules with no resource conditions. If you want resource-qualified rules to take effect, place them before any broad pure-caller rules that cover the same endpoint/tool.

---

## `approval` effect semantics

`approval` routes the call through the approval broker (a separate HTTP process) and opens a browser UI for human confirmation. It does not deny the call — it suspends it pending a decision.

`--yes` bypasses approval when `behavior.allowYes` is true (default). When `allowYes` is false, `--yes` is ignored and approval is always required.

Recommended explicit policy:

```yaml
permission:
  default: allow
  rules:
    - action: write
      effect: approval
      note: "Confirm write operations"
    - action: invoke
      effect: approval
      note: "Confirm invoke operations"
```

## Error taxonomy

| Error code | Source | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| `ENDPOINT_DENIED` | `checkEndpoint()` / `checkTool()` | pure-caller deny rule or default deny |
| `CONTENT_DENIED` | `checkContentRef()` | resource-qualified deny rule or default deny |
| `APPROVAL_UNAVAILABLE` | `executeEndpoint()` | approval required but no workspace resolved (needed to spawn broker) |
| `BLOCK_NOT_FOUND` | id resolution in Phase 2 | block id not found in kernel SQL |
| `CONFIG_PARSE_ERROR` | config loading | invalid config shape or unknown permission rule field |
| `PROJECT_CONFIG_PARSE_ERROR` | project config loading | invalid project config shape or unknown permission rule field |

Exit code `5` (`ExitCode.PERMISSION`) for `ENDPOINT_DENIED` and `CONTENT_DENIED`. Config parse errors use `ExitCode.CONFIG`.
